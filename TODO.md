# TODO

* peek and poke
* control flow (return)
* control flow (break, continue)
* global variables
* reference counted string type
* refrence counted list type
* refrence counted map type
* refrence counted set type
* memory management (some sort of malloc and free)
* 'id' type
    it should be able to represent all pointer
    and <64-bit primitives
* struct/record types
    grouping bits of data together should be possible
    to keep things simple, they should be dumb structs
    behind reference counted pointers


# DONE

* local variable declarations
    instead of requiring them upfront
